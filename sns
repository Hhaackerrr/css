    <h2>Contact Your Home Expert for an Emergency Situation
</h2>
<p>As a homeowner, it’s crucial to spot the signs of water damage or potential water damage.

Not only does it disrupt your life, but it also threatens the safety and health of your family and poses problems to the foundation of your property. The longer your property and possessions are left exposed to wet conditions, the more potential for deadly mold and mildew to grow which will lead to more hazardous conditions. Some water damage conditions such as toilet overflows and sewage backups create terrible odors. It’s important to immediately address the situation to reduce any further damages to your home and remedy the problem with effective water restoration solutions. We are available 24/7 to handle any emergency situation, provide free home water damage restoration estimates, are fully insured for your protection, work directly with all insurance companies and are licensed to work on any water damage restoration project.

      </div>
      <div class="intro-content">
     
        <p>Are you experiencing a case of water damage in your home leaving you frustrated, scared, and overwhelmed? Are you wondering what immediate steps you need to take to confront your disaster claim? If you and your family are in an emergency situation due to water damage, you probably have a variety of questions such as:

</p>
<ul><li>What type of company can help me fix the damages of my home?
</li>
<li>Do I need to contact my insurance company?
</li>
<li>Will my insurance cover the expenses of my home damages?
</li>
<li>Should I keep written and/or photographical records of the damages?
</li>
<li>Who can help me repair and restore my home?
</li></ul>

<p>First, there are disaster relief or water restoration companies that provide emergency assistance helping you through every step of the process. They remove and clean up the damage, collect any evidence relevant to the situation at hand, work with your insurance company to get your claim approved and provide services in restoring your home back to normal.

</p>

<p>As you probably already know, there are specific steps of the process when dealing with any home disaster and with the insurance company, but you may not know what those steps are or in what order to approach the process. The following is a step-by-step process of what you should do for your disaster insurance claim.

          <h2>Step 1: Act instead of reacting!
</h2>
          <p>It is important to stay calm and take immediate action with any emergency. The first and most important thing to do is to make sure that you and your family are safe. Find a safe location that will not put you and family in any physical danger or at health risk. Depending on the severity of the disaster, you should either go to a room or area that is away from the damages or leave your home.

</p>
<p>If a pipe burst and is flooding your home, you should turn off the water from either the source itself or from the main supply but only if it’s within your reach and will not put in danger. If you’re experiencing flooding in your home due to an overflowing river and you’re unable to leave your home, you should go to the top floor or on the roof and calmly wait for assistance.

</p>

<p>If you’re in danger, need medical assistance or a crime has been committed, you should call the police immediately. And remember, even though you’re probably experiencing a mixed of emotions, it is essential to not react resulting in poor judgement; instead, act on the problem that will get you and your family to safety, provide the assistance you need and resolve your situation.

        <div class="step-content">
          <h2>Step 2: Evaluate the damages of your home.
</h2>
          <p>After you tend to the safety and well-being of your family, it is important to review the situation and assess the damages of your home. Safety should still be your main priority but if your home is safe enough to go back inside, then you need to think about what happened and find out what has been damaged. Although the disaster relief company and your insurance will conduct a complete assessment of the damages, any information you have will help you discuss the problem with the disaster relief company. Some questions that can guide you when assessing the problem are:

</p>
<ul>
    <li>Where are the damages in my home?
</li>
    <li>What is the cause of the damages?
</li>
    <li>What specific areas of my home are damaged? Are there broken windows? Are there holes in the roof or in the walls, or cracks in the walls or ceiling?
</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be a good idea to document your assessment of the damages of your home. You can also take pictures as substantial evidence. The disaster relief company will take multiple photographs of the damages but you providing written documentation and pictures of the damages can also help in demonstrating proof of disaster and having your claim approved.

</p>

<p>Another thing to keep in mind is to keep everything in its present condition for a thorough, proper assessment and documentation. In other words, do not clean up any messes. Your insurance company requires detailed documentation of the damages and the overall disaster and if you clean up without providing documentation as evidence of the disaster, your insurance company may deny your claim.

   Had a bad water leak on July 3rd. The result was work needed in two bathrooms and the downstairs ceiling above the kitchen. Called a couple of others, but decided to go with Alex and Your Home Experts. They were easy to communicate with, fought for us against the insurance company, and when work ultimately got started, they did a great job.
They were thorough in protecting our home with plastic drapes and floor covering. They were timely, worked all day sans lunch, from 7-5. Cleaned up after themselves daily, and when the work was finished, and a cleaner came through to finish up.
No complaints whatsoever. I’ve already recommended them to a friend for remodel work.

           We approached YHE earlier this year when we were closing on a house. We had about 6 weeks before move in and it was a major project. For starters, 4 bathrooms, new floors, new fireplace, new stairs, new paint.

I met with a few contractors but YHE was the only one that looked me in the eye and promised that they would get it done in time.

The day the previous owners vacated the house, Alex and his team started demolition. We had nothing ordered or finalized for the house at that point. Alex explained that they usually don’t start a job with nothing ready to go so it would be a challenge, but doable.

Over the next few weeks, we stayed in close contact with Alex and our project team, ordering things for the house and making decisions as reno was underway.

We’re fortunate that YHE was willing and serious about helping us meet our goal. As promised, the house was ready for move in by the date promised.

I will say that not everything went smoothly. I assume that’s typical of any reno, but the most important thing is that Alex cares about customer satisfaction above all else and he will not stop working with you until you’re happy. For me, that’s a sign of good, responsible management and it’s why I would trust YHE again with any future projects.

We also worked with Miki on window treatments and he was very professional as well.
